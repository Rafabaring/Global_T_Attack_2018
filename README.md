# Global_T_Attack_2018
This analyzis was conducted as a step of the fellowship.ai recruitment process. In this repository, you will find the jupyter notebook and the dataset required to run the analyzes

The dataset was download from this website (http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/). In this analyzes you will need only the file "globalterrorismdb_0617dist.xlsx". It consolidates all the data that are in the other .xls files

The codebook is also an extremely relevant tool for this analyzes. Before even start with any code line, I highly recommend spending some time reading and understanding what the data means and the source of it. During my analyzes, I made a couple of references to it in the jupyter notebook

WHAT TO RUN

Download the jupyter notebook "Global T Attack.ipynb" and the dataset "globalterrorismdb_0617dist.xlsx". Make sure they are in the same directory and you are good to go

WHAT WILL YOU FIND

My purpose in this study is to apply simple techniques to derive to a model result. As a data scientist, I value the accuracy and precision of the model, but I'm also careful with the amount of time and cost spent to come with results. So I'm trying to balance cost and benefits through all this exercise

WHAT TO EXPECT

Techniques of data cleaning and sckit learning model applications. Also evaluation of the results tools and next steps

Please, feel free to download, evaluate, analyze, comment and give me feedback on my work. I truly believe that people grow with constructive feedback. I'm very excited to hear what you have to say about my work.

Have fun
